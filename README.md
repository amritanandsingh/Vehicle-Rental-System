# Vehicle Rental System

## Description:
The Vehicle Rental System project aims to develop a user-friendly software application that enables users to rent and manage various types of vehicles, such as cars, motorcycles, and bicycles, from a rental agency. This system will provide an efficient and automated way for customers to search, rent, return, and manage vehicles, while also offering administrative capabilities for the rental agency staff to handle bookings, vehicle availability, and customer information.

## Scope & Overview:
The scope of the Vehicle Rental System is to provide the implementation of the functional requirements mentioned below. The system must be developed in the Unix environment using C++ Programming language, File IO, and Data Structures.

## Functional Requirements:
The application has the following modules:
1. **Administrator Module**: Administrators can manage bookings, view customer details, update vehicle availability status, and generate reports.
2. **Customer Module**: Customers can search for available vehicles based on criteria like type, availability, and price range and book vehicles.

## Detailed Specifications:

### 1. Project Setup and User Interface Design:
- Set up a C++ development environment using an appropriate IDE like Code::Blocks, Visual Studio, or any other preferred tool.
- Plan and design the user interface of the application, including menus, forms, and screens for customer interactions and administrative tasks.

### 2. Data Modeling:
- Design the data structures to store information about vehicles, customers, bookings, and rental agency staff.
- Define classes such as Staff, Customer, Vehicle, and Booking to represent different entities.

### 3. Implementing Vehicle and Customer Management:
- Create classes for different vehicle types (car, motorcycle, bicycle) derived from the base Vehicle class.
- Implement functions to add, update, and delete vehicles and customers.
- Include features for searching and displaying available vehicles based on criteria like type, availability, and price range.

### 4. Booking and Rental Functionality:
- Develop a booking mechanism that allows customers to select vehicles, specify rental dates, and make reservations.
- Ensure that booked vehicles are marked as unavailable during the booking period.
- Implement features for calculating rental charges based on the type of vehicle and the rental duration.

### 5. Administrative Features:
- Create a login system for rental agency staff and associated permissions.
- Develop functionalities for staff to manage bookings, view customer details, and update vehicle availability status.
- Include the ability to generate reports, such as a list of bookings for a specific day or a summary of revenue earned.

### 6. Vehicle Return and Invoice Generation:
- Implement procedures for customers to return rented vehicles.
- Calculate the final rental charges, considering any additional fees (fuel, damage, late return, etc.).
- Generate an invoice with all relevant details and charges for the customer.

### 7. Error Handling and Validation:
- Implement input validation to ensure that users enter valid data for dates, vehicle choices, and other fields.
- Include error handling mechanisms to gracefully handle exceptions and unexpected scenarios.

### 8. Testing and Debugging:
- Thoroughly test the application by simulating different usage scenarios, covering both normal and edge cases.
- Debug and fix any issues that arise during testing.

### 9. Finalization and Presentation:
- Polish the user interface to ensure a smooth and user-friendly experience.
- Prepare a presentation that showcases the features, functionalities, and design of the Vehicle Rental System.
